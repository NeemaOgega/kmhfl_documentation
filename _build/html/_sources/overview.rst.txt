Overview
=========
The Kenya Master Health Facility List Application is primarily built for the public users.
It allows you to instantly identify facilities nearby in regard to the health service selected.i.e maternity,laboratory or emergency services. It also gives an opportunity to give a comment on how well the hospital served you. The application works with the geolocator which picks the location of the user and maps the nearby facilities depending on the service required by the user.
