CHAPTER 1: Introduction
========================
Background
-----------
The Kenya Master Health Facility List application is basically built for the public. It provides listings for health
services provided by the ministry of health,non-governmnental organisations and faith-based organisations across the
country. Identification of nearby facilities in regard to the health service needed is made possible  which is indeed
a helpful thing when someone needs to find a health facility around the place they are. It also gives an opportunity
to comment on how well the health facilities served you. The app works with the geolocator which aids in mapping the
location of the user. Sections of the dashboard, registered facilities and the facility locator are provided to help
easen using the application.

Problem Statement
------------------
Currently, the Kenya Master Health Facility List system has a limited audience
for its use. That is, the general public cannot be aided with the system in
locating facilities to access services needed.
Also, dissagregation of the health facility location is based on the old
administrative hierachy.
This calls for a redesign of the system in the form of a progressive web app
to a more mobile friendly state and improve mobile user experience. In doing
this, generation of dashboard summary reports, good visualization of existing
data and extending of health facility location disaggregation functionality
will be involved.

Objectives
-----------
To develop and application that will help users locate facilities so as to
access services they need.
