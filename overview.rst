The Kenya Master Health Facility Application is basically built for the public users.
It allows you to identify facilities nearby in regard to the health service needed.i.e 
maternity,laboratory or child care services. It also gives an opportunity to give a
comment on how well the hospital served you. The application works with the geolocator
which helps to map the location of the user. Sections of the dashboard, registered 
facilities and the facility locator are provided to help easen using the application.
